#+TITLE: Readme

This is an extension made for chromium based browsers for the Malleus Clinical Medicine Project. Please read more about the project [[https://malleuscm.notion.site/Malleus-Clinical-Medicine-Anki-Project-AU-NZ-97b71e792df64006a2016e1f1c5548b0?pvs=74][here]]. 

* Showcase
Easily search the Malleus Clinical Medicine deck for flashcards related to the currently open webpage.

* Features
You can now use this together with the following sites:
- [[malleuscm.notion.site][malleuscm.notion.site]]
- [[https://emedici.com/app/qbank][emedici]]
- [[https://tgldcdp.tg.org.au/etgAccess][eTG Complete]]
  
* Usage
*Malleus Clinical Medicine Website*: search for any disease you may want to find cards on using the search icon at the top right of the website (e.g. atrial fibrillation). Open the page and then click the Malleus extension button from your toolbar. A anki browser window should appear with all the relevant cards. Currently only supports pages from the subject tags database (i.e. diseases), so this will not work on the pharmacology page for example.

Review questions as you would in eMedici and simply click the Malleus extension button in your toolbar to bring up a anki browser window with all the relevant cards

Open any page on eTG and the relevant cards and click the Malleus extension button in your toolbar to bring up the relevant anki cards in an anki browser window.

Note that you can also use the right click context menu if you prefer. Please note that extensions which edit the html or look of the page (e.g. the Amboss extension) may interferer with the use of this extension.
